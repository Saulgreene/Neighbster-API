# Neighbster-API
###### Allowing users to upload their unused tools and share them with one another.

## Current Version
  * Our current version of Neighbster-API is a backend application with routes allowing for one to Create, Read, Update, and Destroy information. The API includes models for Users, Profiles, Tools, and Transactions between users.

## Future Versions
  * Moving forward Neighbster will have a front end and eventually be integrated with social media allowing users to share tools with their friends. Future versions will also include item allowances for things other than tools.

## API Structure
  ### Bearer Authorization
  * For all routes except api/signup and api/signin, bearer authorization is required for all POST, PUT, and DELETE requests.

  * Bearer authorization requires headers, with a Key of Authorization and a Value of "Bearer [users token]".


# Routes

## api/signup

### POST
  * Creating User: In the request one should provide a Username, Password, and Email. One must create a user in order to sign in to the API.

        Example: {"username": "dFarmer", "password": "somePassword", "email":"exampleuser@example.com" }

        The API will then return a token which will be needed for bearer authorization.

## api/signin

### GET
  * Sign In: In order to sign in once a user has been created Authorization is required from the user. This is provided in the form of the users "Username" and "Password".

  * Username and password should be provided through basic authorization.

  * API will respond with a token.

## api/tools

### POST
  * Creating Tools: With this route a user can create a tool for others to see and check out. This route uses bearer authorization to make sure that there is a user associated with the creating of the tool. If you have not made a user account at this point, it is required to create one.

  * Tool must be uploaded with form-data.

  * Fields for POST:  
    (REQUIRED)  
    -toolName  
    -toolDescription  
    -category  
    -image file (image of the tool)  

    (OPTIONAL)  
    -toolInstructions  
    -serialNumber  

  * API Response (Tool Object)

### GET
  * Viewing Tools: Any visitor to the site will be able to view created tools without authorization, however it will be read only unless one has a user account with the site.

        API will return a Tool object.


### PUT
  * Updating Tools: Only the user that posted the tool is able to update the tool in any way due to bearer authorization. It is simply a matter of including the desired property to change in JSON format and passing it into a PUT request.

  * Fields for PUT:  
    -At least one field from the tool properties is required (SEE Fields for POST above)  

    -A user can update as many fields as desired, not limited to one.
